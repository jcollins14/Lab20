            Hi there! I'm an aspiring developer currently located in the Grand Rapids, MI area, who is learning C# and back-end web development. I currently work at the Van Andel Institute fulltime as the nightly Control Room Technician, and also attend Grand Circus' development bootcamp to further my coding skills. I am looking to transition into a tech career, so if you would like to reach out to me or check out any of my related projects, feel free to check the links below to contact me or browse my Github.
